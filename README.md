# Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary

This is my passion project of re-typesetting the 1898 printing of Le Petit Office in Plainchant notation. It will be the English translation of the original French edition as well as have English translations alongside the Latin text. The plain chant will be re-typeset using Gregorio, a software for writing Gregorian chant.

**Technology:** Gregorio/GABC, LaTeX
