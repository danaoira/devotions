# Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary

This is my passion project of re-typesetting the 1898 printing of Le Petit Office in Plainchant notation. I wish to share this beautiful devotion with the world & hope to someday have it printed into a beautiful pocket leather book. 

It will be the English translation of the original French edition as well as have English translations alongside the Latin text.

The plain chant will be re-typeset using Gregorio, a software for writing Gregorian chant.

Editing will be done in Canva. I will be seeking a printing company who can do printing for soft cover leather books with a print volume of 1000 copies.
